A - Fight!
Twist on the theme of Fight! is Showdown. The two
warbands start about 25 yards apart and walk towards each
other taking a Nerve test each turn untill someone`s nerve
breaks and the fighting begins.

The objective is (d19 on Objective table) which
Warband One want to (d6 on Action table) whilst
Warband Two want to (d6 on Action table) it.

B - Scavangers
Warbands start on opposite sides of the board and only
have a rough idea of where their target is and what the area
is like. The main diffrence between the Scavangers and
the Raid scenatio is that in this scenario neither side starts
off in possession of the target item(s).

The most common variation on this theme is to have
multiple items of varying value or usefulness that the
warbands fight over.

Warband one is trying to (d6 on Action table)
(d19 on Objective table). Whilst Warband Two is
trying to (d6 on Action table) (d19 on Objective table).
Both are interested in (d19 on Objective table).

C - Crossing
One warband is trying to cross an area
guarded by another warband.

Randomly determine which is attacking and which is
the defending warband.

The defending warband has set up camp near
(d19 on Objective table). The attacking warband is attempting to
cross the area in order to get to (d19 on Objective table).

D - Breakout
One warband starts in the center of the board,
surrounded by their opponents (plus any NPC forces).
The surrounded warband then has to escape via
designated board egde.

Randomly determine which is the attacking
and which is the defending warband.

E - Raid
One warband is in possesion of the target and must defend
it at all costs. Often only half the defending warband
start on the board; the rest arriving only after alarm has
been raised.

The alarm could be raised if one of the guards is attacked and
survives that turn, if they spot an opponent acting suspiciously
or if there is a lot of gunfire. The attacking warband usually has
to take/destroy/use the target then leave by designated board edge.

Randomly determine which is the attacking
and which is the defending warband.

The defending warband is in control of (d19 on Objective table).
(d9 on Chacarters Present table) is/are on guard. The attacking
warband is trying to (d6 on Action table) the target.
